System Specifications

Create a website displaying 10 football clubs for the premier league and other infomation such as Premier League Table. Users should 
be able to select one football club. Each football club will have a page containing information about the club and its players, which 
would link to another page that displays player details.
Users should be able to add comments about the players and user's are able to reply to each other’s comments. 
Manager should be able to moderate and delete user comments and block users who post too many out-of-order or offensive comments. 
Each player will have a “score: number of fans”, so that there’s a league table of players that you can use to see the most/least 
popular player. 
Manager should be able to place adverts (multiple adverts) on each page, and know how many times each ads get clicked on.  
Users should be able to watch video segments of a football game.
